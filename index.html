        Data Saturdays has been created as a place for the community create a set of tools and single point to enable people to run small regional events with little outlay or set-up difficulties to have open, transparent discussions on how it should be set up and utilised.

Goals
Provide a website for listing events taking place around the world
Enable event owners to be able to set up the website and administer it easily
Administrative tools for event organizers to use when building their site
Integration with various payment providers for different locales
Integration with mobile scheduling applications
Page to list all sponsors and their contacts
Rating of sessions and events
Speaker tools
Sponsor tools
However, this is not to say that these tools should be created by the community in this repository. To paraphrase Jeffrey Snover, don't build what you don't need to, concentrate on the things that provide value. My view is that some of these things already exist and what is required is a way to consolidate them and make it easy for people to use them. Don't re-invent the wheel.

Culture
We expect and demand that you follow some basic rules. Nothing dramatic here. There will be a proper code of conduct for the websites added soon, but in this repository

BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER

Do I need to say more? If your behaviour or communication does not fit into this statement, we do not wish for you to help us.

What can you do?
We have issues and discussions
We would like you to comment on them and provide help and assistance
We will have code to write and CI/CD to create
We have no idea what else is required, thats for you, the community, to decide
What this is not
For profit
Owned by anyone - This is by the community for the community and will succeed or fail in that manner.
Holding any personal information
Associated with any organisation. We appreciate that in general the events we are looking to provide for will be primarily catering for Microsoft products.


Following the announcement of the ending of PASS (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201219035705/https://www.pass.org/PASS-Blog/the-future-of-pass">archived link</a>), this site has been established by the community as a means to continue events under the <i>Data Saturdays</i> name.
 We believe that by sharing these resources and enabling community input, we can provide the same level of events that SQLSaturdays provided.
